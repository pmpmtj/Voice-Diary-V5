I recorded two audio files in succession. The first entry introduces the first audio file aimed at assessing how the system manages multiple files. Shortly after, I recorded the second entry to further evaluate batch processing, confirming my intent to ensure efficient handling of audio recordings. This testing phase is crucial for optimizing my future entries.",
